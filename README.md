# Simple XMAS Lights for kids from salvaged LED strip

Uses WS2801 LED strip. Displays some basic colors (and pink:) rainbow and rotating rainbow. Controllable by a trivially debounced single button. Runs off a 5V powerbank or USB. Since the WS2801 does not tolerate initial voltage spikes well, it should be protected by a large capacitor first.
